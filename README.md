## ðŸ§  Machine Learning (ML)
### ðŸ“Œ Personality Type Prediction Based on Behavioral Traits

- Developed a classification model to predict personality types â€” Introvert, Ambivert, Extrovert â€” using behavioral features such as creativity, planning habits, and stress-handling ability, and more.

## ðŸ§¬ Deep Learning (DL)
### ðŸ“Œ Vehicle Image Classification (CNN)

- Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images as vehicle or non-vehicle, with applications in traffic monitoring, smart parking, and surveillance systems.

## âš¡ Model Performance

### Machine Learning (Personality Type Prediction)
- Top Performers: Multi-Classification and Naive Bayes achieved 99.39% accuracy, the most reliable models.
- Strong Candidates: SVC (99.28%), KNN (99.08%), and Random Forest (98.80%) showed strong performance.
- Lower Accuracy: Decision Tree models (~93.5%) are less suitable without further tuning.
- Overall: Accuracy ranges from 93.44% to 99.39%, indicating the dataset is well-suited for ML models. 

### Deep Learning (Vehicle Image Classification)
- Built a CNN to classify images as Vehicle or Non-Vehicle.
- Achieved high accuracy on training and testing data.
- Predicted most images correctly; minor errors with trees/backgrounds.
- Confirms CNNs are effective for image classification.
